# LoRa Neural Network Weight Tuning

This project aims to apply lorarize to fine-tune the weights of a `nn.Linear` model in PyTorch.

## How to Use

To use this code, you need to run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model_path /path/to/your/model
```

You need to define your own train, test and model architecture
